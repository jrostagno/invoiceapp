# InvoiceApp

This project was created with Nextjs, MongoDb, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

# Description
This is a personal App that I made with the aim of taking control of my invoice amount. As a contributor, you must be aware of not crossing the limits of your yearly invoiced amount according to your category as a taxpayer. So InvoiceApp allows you to load your invoiced and the algorithm calculated the total amount invoiced from the last twelve months from today. The app is multi-user, and anyone with a GitHub account can log in. Also, you can use it on mobile!
